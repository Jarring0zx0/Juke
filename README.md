## Overview

Juke serves as a convenient and user-friendly SDK for connecting your custom bots (trained and exported with GigaLearn) directly into Rocket League. With a simple configuration and injection step, you can operate your AI in-game with minimal effort.

---

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Bot

- Download/build your GigaLearn bot and locate its exported files.
- In the `Bot` folder provided with Juke, paste all necessary files from your bot (POLICY.lt and SHARED_HEAD.lt).

### 2. Configuring Juke

Edit the configuration in the UI to set the following values:

- **ToggleKey**: The key you want to use to toggle the bot in-game.  
  Default value: `R`

- **BotType**: For now, leave this as `"GGL_PPO"`.  
  (More types will be supported in the future.)

- **POLICY_SIZE, USE_SHARED_HEAD, SHARED_HEAD_SIZE, ObsBuilder, obsSize, device, tickSkip, actionDelay**:  
  These values **must match the specifications used to train/export your bot**. Consult the bot's documentation or ask the bot creator for these numbers (or set them accordingly if you own the bot).
  Currently, Juke is built to support only AdvancedObsPadded, though other obs types may be supported in the future.
  Leave the device to "cuda", else the cpu will be used.

- **Activation**: Supported values: "relu" (default), "leaky_relu", "tanh", "sigmoid", "elu", "selu", "gelu", "swish" (or "silu") .
- ObsBuilder (important!)
  - AdvancedObsPadded1v1 (the obsSize produced will be 109 , same as AdvancedObs, but not to make the confusion that they are the same! the OBS is entirely different, the size is similar)
  - AdvancedObsPadded2v2
  - AdvancedObsPadded or AdvancedObsPadded3v3 - **the normal AdvancedObsPadded**. produces an obsSize of 237. If you trained your bot with the normal AdvancedObsPadded (no teamsize modifications), please use this.
  - AdvancedObsPadded4v4 - if you have an AdvancedObsPadded version with a teamSize of 4 in the header file, you should use this.
  - AdvancedObs (normal advanced obs , size produced is 109)

## Injecting the Bot

1. Download the latest release build without the dependencies. Place it in a folder.
2. In that same folder, download the dependencies and extract them.
How it should look like in the end:

## Notes

- Double-check every config value for accuracy; failure to match the bot's true specs may prevent it from running correctly.
- Juke is designed for use with bots generated by the GigaLearn framework. Third-party or custom solutions do not work as of today.
- Future versions of Juke will support more bot types and additional features.
- This software is designed for educational & research purposes. Any misuse of the software is not to blame on the creator.
